## About Me
I am a recent graduate at [Utrecht University](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), and my research background is in gene editing and computational antibody modelling. I'm interested in computational methods for research in regenerative medcine and aging.

## GSoC Project

- [GSoC Project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ylOolPrk)
